		<p>The form of sketching where an artist takes their canvas to the great outdoors and quickly perform a color sketch of the skies above; they then take their color sketches back inside to elaborate on. These days many anime artists tend to rely on pochade because of how easy it is. It is essentially used to capture the scenic beauty, with overindulgence in the sky. Fans of the popular anime genre would tell you about how detailed every inch of the anime is; thus these pochades come in handy for artists, who are trying to recreate real-life in their work. Pochade is an upgraded version of croquis; croquis doesnâ€™t involve the use of colors and also are used for sketching several different scenes, objects, and emotions. Vincent Van Gogh is a famous artist who used to use the pochade; he was known to take his canvas or the surface he was painting on, outside, and then finish up his work indoors. Van Gogh would sketch on the surface of the canvas and believed that the pochade was a great skill to possess.
