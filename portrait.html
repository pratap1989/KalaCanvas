		<p>Portrait sketches are known to be the hardest form of sketching; because they were able to stand alone as works of art themselves, without having to work further on them. These days they are used to find the perfect angle at which to draw someone; typically a person is drawn from multiple angles and then the perfect angle is chosen. A wide array of paints and canvases can be used in a portrait sketch and many believe that portrait sketches are only diminished by the imagination of the sketcher. The portrait sketch is also used to capture subtle emotional expressions on canvas.
